In its first form, the mv utility renames the file named by the
     source operand to the destination path named by the target operand.
     This form is assumed when the last operand does not name an already
     existing directory.

     In its second form, mv moves each file named by a source operand to
     a destination file in the existing directory named by the directory
     operand.  The destination path for each operand is the pathname
     produced by the concatenation of the last operand, a slash, and the
     final pathname component of the named file.

     The following options are available:

     -f      Do not prompt for confirmation before overwriting the des-
             tination path.  (The -f option overrides any previous -i or
             -n options.)

     -i      Cause mv to write a prompt to standard error before moving
             a file that would overwrite an existing file.  If the
             response from the standard input begins with the character
             `y' or `Y', the move is attempted.  (The -i option over-
             rides any previous -f or -n options.)
             
      -n      Do not overwrite an existing file.  (The -n option over-
             rides any previous -f or -i options.)

     -v      Cause mv to be verbose, showing files after they are moved.

     It is an error for either the source operand or the destination
     path to specify a directory unless both do.

     If the destination path does not have a mode which permits writing,
     mv prompts the user for confirmation as specified for the -i
     option.
